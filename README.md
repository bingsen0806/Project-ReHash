# Project-ReHash
Project ReHash is a website for users to swap away their unwanted items to obtain something useful.

The interesting idea about Project ReHash is that users can <b>SWAP ANYTHING WITH EVERYTHING</b>, including intangibles

Are you bad at math but good at writing? Simply look for someone who's good at math but needs writing help and swap away!

Want to take a break from football? May some musicians would be glad to give you an music experience session in exchange for some outdoor activities!

Into Pokemon Trading Card Games but none of your friends share your hobby? Swap your cards and collections with like-minded people at ReHash!
